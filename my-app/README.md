"My-App" only exists because I needed to use yarn to get a package that allows me to do RSA encryption/decryption. This is not actually a React.js project. I am just using the compiled JavaScript output of "My-App" to allow the website to do RSA encryption/decryption. I wish there was a simpler way of loading an RSA library into vanilla JS but, unfortunately, there isn't.
