                Proof-of-work is currently the most popular method of securing blockchains. But, most proof-of-work blockchains have one major flaw: they're not scalable. They're slow, they're inefficient, and they require a ton of energy.
            </section>
            <section>
                That's why Hippow was created. Hippow utilizes the abilities of humans, rather than computers, to do "work".
            </section>
            <section>
                The Hippow blockchain is fast, lightweight, and efficient. Hippow doesn't need to waste any energy to keep the blockchain secure. Before we get into all that, let's first discuss how you can get started earning Hippow coins. 
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class="header">Getting Started</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                By visiting this website, you've already created your own personal Hippow wallet. Your wallet is currently displaying your balance in the top right corner of the screen. Hover over your wallet to see your public address and your private key. NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY. It is only okay to give out your public address. That is the address people will use to send you Hippow coins.
            </section>
            <section>
                Now that you have a wallet, it's time to fill it up. You can earn Hippow coins by helping to secure the Hippow network. This process is simple. Here's how:
            </section>
            <section>
                1. Locate the blockchain tab on the left side of the screen. This shows every transaction that has ever taken place on the Hippow network.
            </section>
            <section>
                2. Click on a "Pending" transaction. Try refreshing the blockchain if there aren't any pending transactions.
            </section>
            <section>
                3. Every transaction has an image associated with it. To approve the transaction, you must be the first person to guess the secret word for that image. You have unlimited guesses. Correct guesses earn Hippow coins!
            </section>
            <section>
                Here are some tips for guessing: The secret word will always be an object that you can see somewhere in the image, usually in the background. It will always be a noun, but never a proper noun. To familiarize yourself with this process, you can click on any "Confirmed" transaction to see what the secret word was for that transaction's image.

                <h2 class="header">Why Hippow?</h2>
            </section>
            <!-- <section>
                An important aspect of any good blockchain is that it is decentralized. That means that no central authority controls it. The advantage of decentralization is that you don't have to trust anybody. But, how can the blockchain remain secure if nobody is in charge of it?
            </section> -->
            <section>
                Proof-of-work blockchains, like Bitcoin, have many mathematical solutions in place to ensure they are kept secure. Perhaps the most important of these security features is the nonce: a number only used once. Thousands and thousands of computers across the world are currently competing to find the nonce for the lastest block in the blockchain. This is called mining. Here is how many guesses it currently takes, on average, to find this nonce on the Bitcoin blockchain:
            </section>
            <section>
                <div class="justify-center">
                    <img id="equation-image" src="images/equation.png" />
                </div>
                <div id="equation-subtext">
                    (That's over a billion trillions!)
                </div>
            </section>
            <section>
                As you can imagine, it takes a ton of energy for computers to make that many guesses. Considering the fact that a new block is created about every 10 minutes, you can see how wasteful this process is. In fact, Bitcoin mining uses more energy than entire countries like Belgium and New Zealand. Hippow doesnt waste energy on securing the blockchain because it uses humans, rather than computers, to do work.
            </section>
            <section>
                Not only is energy waste an issue, but the "work" itself is wasted. A Bitcoin nonce helps to secure the blockchain but doesn't actually provide any value to the world. It's only used once. By contrast, the work done to secure the Hippow blockchain is actually useful. Many artificial intelligence companies, such as those developing self-driving cars, need massive amounts of data to train their neural networks. They're even willing to pay for it. By identifying objects in images, Hippow users are providing this crucial data.
            </section>
            <section>
                It also seems wasteful that Bitcoin mining increases in difficulty as more miners join the network. This means that, as Bitcoin's popularity increases, the amount of energy wasted increases exponentially. The addition of more miners doesn't even speed up the process. If more people are working together to solve a problem, shouldn't that problem get solved faster? The Hippow network solves these issues by keeping the difficulty fixed, making it much more scalable.
            </section>
            <section>
                There are several side-effects of Hippow's unique consensus algorithm that are actually huge bonuses. For example, the fact that images are used to secure the network means that anyone with an internet connection and a computer can earn coins. No mining rig necessary. Because the network is based in the browser, this also means that Hippow users can easily explore the blockchain and understand the mining process with first-hand experience. It can be a useful learning tool to understand the complicated world of crypto. In the future, mining Hippow coins could even be a full-time job for some people.
            </section>
            <section>
                In conclusion, here are the benefits of the Hippow network over other proof-of-work blockchains:
